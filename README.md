# A brief introduction of the data:

Data consists of info about trips, 
for February of 2019 taken by ford gobike service's members, their types, their age, their gender, stations of starting and ending trips, duration of trips etc.

# Summary:

We start with some cleaning (drop missing values/duplicated values), 
fix data types and drop useless columns. We focus on trip durations, 
member's age/gender and user type. 
From start_time column we make start_day column and from member_birth_year we make member_age column.

# A description of the key insights:

I picked one plot from every exploration kind (Univariate/Bivariate/Multivariate):

* Univariate: The count of Males, Females and Others Plot
* Bivariate: The relationship between riders' Ages and their trip duration
* Multivariate: The relationship between user type, trip duration and user type
